R package with functions we can all benefit from

## Before we begin
* Best practices on how to write an R package are detailed in Hadley Wickham's [book](https://r-pkgs.org/).
* Best practices on R function writing can be found  in the books [`R for Data Science`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) and the [`Functions chapter of Advanced R`](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functions.html).

## Introduction
New functions need to be written in an R script file following the predefined format **TODO:check reference function** and saved in the `R/` directory. For ease of use the R script name should be the same as the function name.
